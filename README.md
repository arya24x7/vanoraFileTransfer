# VANORA FILE TRANSFER

## Introduction

VANORA FILE TRANSFER is a project aimed at simplifying the process of transferring Arduino code files (.ino) to an Arduino board using a web interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with VANORA FILE TRANSFER, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arya24x7/vanoraFileTransfer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```
   cd vanoraFileTransfer
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit web interface:**
   ```
   streamlit run interface2.py
   ```

4. **Once the Streamlit server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the provided address (typically http://localhost:8501). You should see the VANORA FILE TRANSFER interface.**

5. **In the interface, upload the .ino file containing your Arduino code by clicking on the "Upload" button. The code will be sent to the bot for flashing onto the Arduino board.**

6. **Once the flashing process is complete, your Arduino board is ready to go!**

## Additional Notes

- To generate Arduino code using block coding, you can visit [VANORA Blockly](https://vanorablockly.netlify.app/) and use the provided block coding interface.
